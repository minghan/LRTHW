Already know php and python (and a bit of rusty perl)...

mostly syntactic sugar...

*   foreach not explained in ex12

*   no clear explanation of chomp in ex14

*   no file.close in ex15? ah ok this is covered in ex16.
    so ex15 was more of an intro

*   ex23 calls files ending in *.c "weird files" =(

*   ex27-28 boolean logic.. hm..
    I like the fact that the "not" keyword is supported, like in python.

*   ex30: "elsif" ? ugly...

*   ex32: ah loops, my fav. primitive recursion. nice.
